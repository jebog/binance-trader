# Binance Trading Scanner

Personal macOS algorithmic scanner that monitors 6 spot pairs every 30 minutes, detects multi-tier RSI + SMA + volume + sentiment buy signals, places confirmed market orders with automatic ATR-based OCO exit brackets, and sends a daily 8am Telegram digest. Includes a max-drawdown circuit breaker that halts new orders if the portfolio drops >15% from its peak.

## Running Modes

### Interactive mode (default)

```bash
python3 scanner.py
```

Runs a full scan, prints results, and if a signal fires prompts:

```
Type CONFIRM to place order(s), or SKIP to skip:
```

Type `CONFIRM` (uppercase) to execute. Anything else skips.

### TUI mode (recommended)

```bash
python3 tui.py
```

Full real-time terminal dashboard. See [TUI App](#tui-app) below.

### Cron / Telegram mode

```bash
SCANNER_CRON=1 python3 scanner.py
```

No stdin prompt. If a signal fires, the scanner sends a Telegram alert and waits up to 120 seconds for a `CONFIRM` or `SKIP` reply. This is what `run_scanner.sh` uses with launchd.

---

## TUI App

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt   # one-time
python3 tui.py
```

The portfolio panel also shows a drawdown warning when the portfolio is below its high-water mark: `⚠ Drawdown: X.X%` (orange, ≥10%) or `🛑 HALTED X.X%` (red, ≥15%).

### Key bindings

| `S` | Run a full scan now |
| `R` | Re-read `state.json` from disk |
| `P` | Toggle left portfolio panel |
| `E` | Toggle left panel: portfolio ↔ equity curve |

### Order confirmation modal

When a signal passes all guards, a modal appears automatically:

```
┌─── 🟠 STRONG BUY SIGNAL ──────────────────────┐
│  Pair:    ETHUSDC                               │
│  Entry:   $1,998.30   RSI 28.4                  │
│  TP:      $2,198.13  (+10.0%)                   │
│  SL:      $1,878.39  (-6.0%)                    │
│  Capital: $200 USDC                             │
│  [✓ CONFIRM  Enter/Y]   [✗ SKIP  Esc/N]        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

TP/SL shown are ATR-estimated — the actual OCO prices are computed from the live fill price after the market order executes.

### Auto-refresh

| Timer | Interval | What it does |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| State watcher | 5 s | Reads `state.json` (disk only — no API calls) |
| Auto-scan | 30 s | Full Binance API scan in background thread |

The TUI and the launchd cron job are independent. When cron writes `state.json`, the TUI detects the update within 5 seconds via the state watcher.

## Strategy

### Pairs monitored

`ETHUSDC` · `ADAUSDC` · `DOGEUSDC` · `BNBUSDC` · `SOLUSDC` · `XRPUSDC`

### Timeframes

- **1h candles** — signal generation (RSI, SMA, volume, ATR)
- **1d candles** — trend filter (fetched per pair, last 30 daily candles)

The daily timeframe classifies each pair's broader trend before the 1h signal is evaluated:

| Daily state | daily RSI | Price vs SMA20 | Effect |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Bullish** | > 45 | above | MODERATE allowed |
| **Neutral** | 30–45 | any | STRONG allowed, MODERATE blocked |
| **Bearish** | < 30 | below | STRONG blocked, EXTREME still fires |

EXTREME signals bypass the daily filter — deep oversold readings are entries regardless of trend.

### Market filters (fetched once per scan)

| Filter | Source | Effect |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Fear & Greed Index** | alternative.me | Blocks MODERATE entries when F&G ≥ 60; blocks STRONG when F&G ≥ 75 |
| **BTC SMA20** | Binance 1h klines | Blocks MODERATE entries when BTC is below its 1h SMA20 |
| **BTC RSI** | Binance 1h klines | Halves STRONG position size to $100 when BTC RSI < 35 |

Both are fetched once and shared across all pairs. F&G is cached in `state.json` for 25 hours. If the live fetch fails, the cache is used. If the cache is also expired, neutral 50 is used and a Telegram warning is sent.

### Signal tiers

| Tier | Condition | Capital |
|------|-----------|---------|
| **EXTREME** (quality) | RSI < 25 AND above SMA20 AND F&G < 40 | $200 |
| **EXTREME** (crash)   | RSI < 25 AND (below SMA20 OR F&G ≥ 40) | $100 — falling knife, halved |
| **STRONG**            | RSI < 32 AND above SMA20 AND F&G < 75 | $200 (or $100 if BTC RSI < 35) |
| **MODERATE**          | RSI < 40 AND above SMA20 AND vol surge AND momentum AND F&G < 60 AND BTC above SMA | $200 |

EXTREME always qualifies regardless of BTC context — deep oversold readings are entries even in fear. Position size is halved when the setup is a falling-knife pattern (below SMA or high F&G).

### Per-scan guards

Applied in this order after signal detection:

1. **Correlation cap** — if ≥ 3 candidates, keep only the lowest-RSI pair (BTC-correlated overexposure)
2. **Circuit breaker** — if portfolio has dropped ≥ `MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT` (15%) from its peak, all candidates are cleared and a Telegram alert is sent (at most once per 4 hours)
3. **Max positions** — skip a signal if `MAX_POSITIONS` are already open
4. **SL cooldown** — skip a symbol for 4 hours after its stop-loss was hit
5. **Open position** — skip if an OCO order already exists for the symbol

> The correlation cap and circuit breaker both run **before** the per-symbol guards so they filter on raw signal quality, not on whatever accidentally survives the guards.

### Indicators

All indicators are calculated on **closed candles only** (`klines[:-1]`). The currently-forming candle is always excluded.

#### RSI — Wilder's EMA (period 14)

Matches TradingView / Binance standard. Seeded with a simple average for the first 14 periods, then Wilder's smoothing:

```
avg_gain = (prev_avg_gain × 13 + current_gain) / 14
RSI = 100 − 100 / (1 + avg_gain / avg_loss)
```

Returns `50.0` if fewer than 14 closed candles are available.

#### SMA20 — Simple Moving Average (period 20)

Average of the last 20 closing prices. Returns `None` if insufficient data — callers treat `None` as "below SMA" (conservative).

#### Volume surge

`current_volume > avg_volume_of_previous_candles × 1.3`

The average excludes the current candle to avoid self-referential inflation.

#### Momentum

`close[-1] > close[-5]` — 5-candle lookback filters single-candle spikes.

#### ATR — Wilder's ATR (period 14)

```
true_range = max(high − low, |high − prev_close|, |low − prev_close|)
ATR        = Wilder's EMA of true_range over 14 periods
```

Used for dynamic SL/TP sizing in `place_buy_order()`.

## Configuration Reference

All settings live in `config.py` — edit only this file, never `scanner.py` directly:

| Constant | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PAIRS` | 6 pairs | Trading pairs to monitor |
| `CAPITAL` | `200.0` | USDC per trade (full-size) |
| `STOP_LOSS` | `0.03` | Fixed SL fallback when ATR disabled (3%) |
| `TAKE_PROFIT` | `0.075` | Fixed TP fallback when ATR disabled (7.5%) |
| `MAX_POSITIONS` | `2` | Maximum concurrent open positions |
| `SL_COOLDOWN_H` | `4` | Hours to pause signals after SL hit |
| `MAX_DRAWDOWN_PCT` | `0.15` | Halt new orders if portfolio drops >15% from its high-water mark |
| `DIGEST_HOUR` | `8` | Local hour (0–23) at which the morning Telegram digest is sent |
| `TRAILING_DELTA` | `150` | Trailing stop in basis points; `0` = disabled |
| `ATR_SL_MULT` | `1.5` | SL = ATR × multiplier; `0` = use fixed `STOP_LOSS` |
| `ATR_TP_MULT` | `3.5` | TP = ATR × multiplier → ~2.33:1 R/R |
| `ATR_SL_MIN` | `0.02` | ATR-based SL floor (2%) |
| `ATR_SL_MAX` | `0.06` | ATR-based SL ceiling (6%) |
| `INTERVAL` | `"1h"` | Candle interval |
| `KLINE_LIMIT` | `100` | Candles fetched per pair (must be ≥ 2 × RSI period to converge) |

**ATR floor note:** When ATR < `ATR_SL_MIN / ATR_SL_MULT`, SL is floored to `ATR_SL_MIN` but TP still scales from the floored SL. The apparent R/R improves beyond what the raw ATR justifies — a conservative bias in flat/low-volatility markets.

                      STOP_LOSS_LIMIT, limit = stop_price × 0.995
```

### SL outcome tracking

After each scan, `_check_sl_outcomes()` queries `allOrders` for every open trade's OCO ID:

- `LIMIT_MAKER` filled → `tp_hit` status, no cooldown
- `STOP_LOSS_LIMIT` / `STOP_LOSS` filled → `sl_hit` status + SL cooldown set
- Both filled (race condition) → TP takes precedence

On either outcome, three fields are written to the trade record in `state.json`:
- `exit_price` — actual avg fill price from `cummulativeQuoteQty / executedQty` (correct for trailing stops)
- `pnl_pct` — `(exit_price − entry) / entry × 100`
- `exit_time` — ISO timestamp of the outcome detection

These fields power the daily digest P&L summary and the drawdown circuit breaker.

---

## Backtest

```bash
python3 backtest.py
```

Fetches 1000 hourly candles (~41 days) per pair from Binance's public API and simulates the same RSI/SMA/Vol/Momentum logic over a rolling 100-candle window. No look-ahead bias — entry is at the close of the signal candle, and exit is scanned forward candle-by-candle.

Results are written to `backtest_results.json` and printed to stdout.

### Limitations

The backtest does **not** simulate:
- Fear & Greed index filter
- BTC context filter
- Correlation cap
- SL cooldowns
- Capital sizing tiers (all trades use $200)
- Slippage or trading fees

### Interpreting results

The most recent run (bear period): 47 trades, 23.4% WR, −4.8% net. Lower than live performance because F&G and BTC filters — which block the majority of falling-knife entries — are absent in the backtest. ADA was the most resilient pair (+6.2% net, 37.5% WR). Use the backtest to validate indicator logic and detect look-ahead bugs, not to project live P&L.

## Dashboard

### TUI (recommended)

```bash
python3 tui.py
```

Live terminal app — see [TUI App](#tui-app).

### HTML dashboard (auto-generated)

```bash
open ~/.agent/diagrams/trading-dashboard.html
```

Generated by `generate_dashboard()` at the end of each scan. Self-contained single-file HTML — no web server required. Shows portfolio allocation, pair tiles, open positions, trade history, and performance stats.

---

## Telegram Integration

### Messages sent

| Trigger | Content |
|---------|---------|
| Each scan | All pairs RSI/signal + open positions P&L + win rate |
| Signal found | Pair, entry, ATR-estimated TP/SL, capital |
| Order placed | Fill price, actual TP/SL, OCO order ID |
| TP hit | Symbol confirmation |
| SL hit | Symbol + cooldown duration |
| F&G regime change | Threshold crossed (20 / 30 / 50) with regime description; once per crossing, deduped via `fg_regime` in state.json |

### Setup

```bash
# 1 — Create a bot via @BotFather on Telegram, copy the token
# 2 — Get your numeric chat ID via @userinfobot or @RawDataBot
# 3 — Add to .env:
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_numeric_chat_id
```

In cron mode, reply `CONFIRM` or `SKIP` to the bot within 120 seconds after a signal alert.

---

## launchd Setup (macOS)

### Install

```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trading.scanner.plist
```

### Verify

```bash
launchctl list com.trading.scanner
# "LastExitStatus" = 0 → last run succeeded
```

### Reload after changes

```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trading.scanner.plist
launchctl load   ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.trading.scanner.plist
```

### Watch live

```bash
tail -f scanner.log
```

---

## Credentials

Credentials are loaded from the `.env` file in the project root (via `python-dotenv`):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env:
BINANCE_API_KEY=your_api_key
BINANCE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=your_bot_token
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_numeric_chat_id
chmod 600 .env
```

Spot trading permission is required on the Binance API key to place orders. Market data (klines, ticker) works without authentication. `.env` is gitignored and will never be committed.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `No module named 'textual'` / `No module named 'dotenv'`
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### TUI crashes with `TypeError: 'dict' object is not callable`

`tui.py` has a class attribute named `_scan_ctx` specifically to avoid shadowing Textual's internal `_context()` method. If you see this error after modifying `tui.py`, check that no class attribute or variable is named `_context` in `ScannerApp`.

### TUI output corrupted or scanner log missing on startup

The `TeeLogger` in `scanner.py` must be guarded:
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sys.stdout = TeeLogger()
```
Without this guard, importing `scanner` from `tui.py` would redirect stdout before Textual initialises, corrupting terminal output.

### No signals firing

RSI above thresholds is normal in trending or neutral markets. EXTREME requires RSI < 25 — this only occurs during significant dips. Check the dashboard or log for current values across all pairs.

### F&G fetch failing

The scanner falls back to a 25-hour cache in `state.json["fg_cache"]`, then to neutral 50 with a Telegram warning. The sentiment filter becomes inactive but signals can still fire (MODERATE will be less filtered). Check internet connectivity if this persists.

### Order rejected: `Filter failure: LOT_SIZE`

The computed quantity is below the exchange minimum. This happens when `CAPITAL / price` is too small. The scanner raises `ValueError` before sending to prevent position-tracking desync.

### SL cooldown stuck

Cooldowns expire automatically. To clear manually:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('state.json') as f: s = json.load(f)
s['cooldowns'] = {}
with open('state.json','w') as f: json.dump(s, f, indent=2)
print('Cooldowns cleared')
"
```

### Dashboard shows stale data

The HTML dashboard updates only when the scanner runs. Trigger a manual scan:
```bash
python3 scanner.py
```

### launchd not running

```bash
launchctl list com.trading.scanner
```
A non-zero `LastExitStatus` indicates a crash. Check the log:
```bash
tail -50 scanner.log
```
If exit code is 126 (permission denied), verify the Python binary path in the `.plist` matches your installed version:
```bash
ls -l /Users/jebog/.pyenv/versions/3.12.4/bin/python3
```
